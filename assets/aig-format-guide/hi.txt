Hey guys! AAG-Visualizer is a side project written in pure js.
Inspired by the final project of Data Structure and Programming at my school.
The goal is to visualize a complex and hard-to-understand circuit raw input file into a pretty and simple .svg file.

(Click 3. Medium (tutorial) if you want to know what the project is about and what aag file format is) 

However, I think this technique can be applied to more fields. For example, DAG, FSM, Blockchain, React Element Tree, Bundle Dependencies Graph...etc. can be implemented by similar methods. Therefore, I wrote a tutorial for using viz.js to build a fantastic visualizer in my Medium. I hope that it could provide help on graph visualizing websites or inspire anyone who has interest in developing similar things.
